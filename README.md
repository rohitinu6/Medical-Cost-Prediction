# Medical Cost Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project estimates medical costs based on patient health records and demographic data. Using machine learning techniques, it helps in predicting healthcare expenses, assisting insurance providers and policymakers.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Machine learning model development for cost prediction
- Model evaluation and optimization

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains the following attributes:

- **Age**
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
- **Smoker status**
- **Number of children**
- **Region**
- **Medical charges** (target variable)

## 📊 Machine Learning Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

## 🔥 Results

The models are evaluated based on R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure prediction accuracy.
